# omegga-midiplayer
 A midi player plugin for omegga that rapidly loads and clears bricks with sound components to create music. Due to the lack of proper instrument sounds, this plugin currently uses some rather dubious sounds to create music. 

## Instructions
 1. `omegga install gh:Lythine/midiplayer`
 2. Put your midis in the `plugins/midiplayer/mid` folder. They will load with the plugin and can be reloaded in-game with the command `/midi-reload`.
